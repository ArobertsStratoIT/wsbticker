A python script to display comments from /r/wallstreetbets in a Times Square style ticker. Watch this ticker for excellent advice on how not to invest your money.

## Features:
- Direct links to comment threads and users for faster flaming/shaming
- A large amount of colored themes
- Always on-top (giggity)
- Inclusion of current stock prices via Yahoo Finance
- Automatic removal of unlucky stock advice once comment queue gets full
- Windows only. Linux maybe on the way. OSX lol
